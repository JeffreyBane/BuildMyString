# BuildMyString

<h3>Description</h3>

A string / Stringbuilder escaper, concatenator and general life improvement PHP application for an enhanced sense of well being and bright outlook for the future of mankind.

BuildMyString was initially developed in 2012 after I got completely sick of building and escaping strings manually and found the tools of the time rather bland, featureless and awful. A rather ghetto system of Disqus suggestions was utilized to incorporate fixes and enhancements. The end result after 6 years of continual development is one of the most useful string builders in existence. https://www.buildmystring.com
